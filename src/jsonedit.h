/* Edits a json document by splicing spans of its text, so every byte outside
   the edited span survives: a generated file whose whole body reformats on
   first write buries the one line that actually drifted.

   path addresses the object to edit, "" for the document root and dotted for a
   nested one ("ferrule.managed"). A missing object along the path is created by
   a set and is left alone by a remove. Keys are compared raw, so a key written
   with a json escape does not match one written without it. */
